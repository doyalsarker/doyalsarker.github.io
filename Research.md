My research focuces on the modeling, simulation, and validation of numerous dynamical systems applied to the sustainable energy systems. Currently, I am working on the developement of an acausal modeling tool that can rapidly simulate aero-hydro coupled dydnamics of floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT).
