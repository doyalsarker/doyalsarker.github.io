Hello, I am Doyal Kumar Sarker. Welcome to my site!



A PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at [University of Central Florida (UCF)](https://www.ucf.edu/). For over four years, I have been working as a Graduate Research Assistant in the [Hybrid Sustainable Energy Systems Laboratory (HySES) Laboratory](https://mae.ucf.edu/TDas/). My research focuses on dynamics and control, multi-physics modeling, and hydrodynamic analysis, with particular emphasis on offshore platforms and floating structures for renewable energy applications. 

In particular my areas of research:
   - Offshore hydrodynamics and Fluid-structure interaction
   - Aero-hydro-servo-elastic coupled modeling of floating wind turbine
   - Ocean Wave Modeling
   - Multi-body Dynamics and Vibration control
   - Computational Fluid Dynamics
   - Finite Element Modeling
